# carrickmines-area-map

Included is a list of local points of interest of my hometown of Carrickmines, Dublin, Ireland.


The program allows you to filter the POIs by typing in upper or lowercase in the search box.
The icons will disappear accordingly as they do not match the parameter of the filter, leaving only 
those that do.

The icons change color and get smaller when moused over, before reverting to a third color when
moused out. Red -> Yellow -> Blue (they stay blue).

Clicking a place name on the side list causes the marker to bounce, as well 
as displaying information about the marker in a small info-window.

This information was drawn from the Foursquare API where available.
